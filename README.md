# LiveScan3D-Hololens
This application is in an early stage, I will try to keep working on it when I have the time. You can also expect a youtube video about it soon (January 2017).
If you have any suggestions feel free to contact me.

## How to get it running with LiveScan3D##
First of all you need to download LiveScan and get that running. Once this is done, open LiveScan, connect a client and open the live view window (it is the contents of that window that are streamed to Hololens). Next start the Unity application on the same machine as the server, if everything is fine it should be working. If it is not working, let me know and I will try to fix it.

If you got this far, getting it to work on Hololens should be easy, once you deploy and start the app on Hololens all you need to do is input the IP number of the server and you should see the point cloud.
